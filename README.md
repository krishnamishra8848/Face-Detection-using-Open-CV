 # Face Detection Web App

This project is a web application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that allows users to upload images or videos, which are processed to detect faces using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). The app provides an intuitive interface for detecting faces in uploaded media files.

## Features

- Upload an image or video.
- Automatic face detection using OpenCV.
- Real-time face detection for videos.
- Displays the image or video with detected faces highlighted.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the app here: [Face Detection Web App](https://face-detection-using-open-cv.onrender.com)

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building user interfaces.
- **OpenCV**: Image and video processing library used for face detection.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Used for handling image file uploads and conversions.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and numerical data.
